I made this project to track the progress of a heads-up (poker 1v1) challenge I played against a friend of mine senior year. This library loads in the data, creates a monte-carlo simulation of our results as well as aggregating some other information. Then it sends out a weekly email to a list of friends who are also following our progress. It will create a properly formatted heads_up_log.txt file which prints out information on how the process is running. Also inorder to replicate the process you need to create your own Private_info file containing your gmail / google account password and your desired email list. The monte_carlo graphs are created in a seperate 'media' folder.
